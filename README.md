# cnsFormatPainter
a Cadence Skill script to copy and paste component property visibility and location in DEHDL

This happened because, during an attempt to convert a schematic between two versions of DEHDL (16.9 to 17.2), the visibility of ALL component properties in the schematic was turned off. I don't want to touch each component in the schematic to turn the visibility back on and arrange each property in a sensible way, so I'm attempting to add some automation. Plus I get to learn a wonderful new language, Cadence's "Skill."
